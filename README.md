Image Processing Program
This repository contains a C program designed to perform various image processing tasks. It supports operations like image loading, transformations, filtering, and saving, with functionalities for handling multiple images simultaneously.
Features
The program provides the following functionality:

Load Images: Load BMP images into memory using read_from_bmp.
Save Images: Save processed images back to BMP format using write_to_bmp.
Transformations:
Horizontal Flip: Mirror an image along the horizontal axis.
Rotate Left: Rotate an image 90 degrees counter-clockwise.
Crop: Extract a rectangular section of an image.
Extend: Add borders to an image.
Paste: Overlay one image onto another.
Filters:
Create and apply custom filters to images.
Remove filters from memory.
Memory Management:
Dynamic memory allocation and deallocation for images and filters.
